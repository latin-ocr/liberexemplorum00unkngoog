(194) This version differs slightly from that in the Gemma
Eccles. The phrase ⁴ Swete lemman thin are [ore] ’ (“ Sweet
darling thy pity ⁹) is a common one: Prof. Ker sends me
from the Lyrics in Harl. MS. 225 3 :—

Ich have loved al this yer
That 1 may love namore:

Ich have siked moni syk,
Lemman, sor thin ore.

Prof. Ker also informs me there is a modern ballad on the
same story in Arbaud’s Chants provenfaux.

Lausiac History of Palladius, in J. A. Robinson’s Texts and

modified as recommended in the text. (Cf. Thom. Cantiprat.‚
Bonum Univ. de Apibus (ed. 1597), lib. ii., cap. xxx, 19,
p. 267.)
