(184) The rmuscstafion of the fraudulent debtor does not
occur in Giraldus cambrensis, nor in the old metrioel version in
WrIght's Reliquiae antiquae, ii„ 199. (The Miraculum printed
in Wright’s Early Mysteries‚ p. 1 1, may perhaps be regarded as
a sequel.) The story is quoted in Leg. Aurea, p. 27 ; Vincent.

(187) Rob. de Brunne, Handlyng Synne, p. 50, cites this

the latter year he was Vicar of the general master, and was de-
