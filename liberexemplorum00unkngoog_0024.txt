xviii IN TRODUCTION

N aturally the book does not add much to our
knowledge of eventS. The armed attack on the Dublin
convent has already been noticed. A sew new names
may be added to the lists of Dominican and Franciscan
writers. From one incidental reference it seems prob-
able that a Provincial Prior of the Friars Preachers in
England -ε- Simon de Henton— has been placed a
century too late by the historians of the Order (51).—
Lastly, the allusions to the high wages of ‘ those
employed clean out the latrines in great cities’ (208)
may be of interest to the student of mediaeval town—
life.

In conclusion, Ι desire to acknowledge the obliga—
tions os the Society to the Dean and Chapter of Dur·
ham for permission to print the Liber Exemplorum, and
personally to express my was-mest thanks to Dean
Kitchin, whose kind help and hospitality turned the
task of copying the MS. into a pleasure.
